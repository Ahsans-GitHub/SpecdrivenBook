Specification for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" Textbook Introduction This specification document (specify.md) builds directly upon the constitution.md, providing detailed blueprints for generating the complete textbook content in Phase 1. It outlines the structure, content requirements, and generation guidelines for all modules, chapters, lessons, weeks, levels, and associated elements. The goal is to create a rich, content-heavy textbook that is hands-on, multi-level (beginners to intermediates to experts to researchers), and optimized for Docusaurus deployment. All content must be generated in Markdown format, with heavy details including code examples, diagrams (described in text or via Mermaid/PlantUML if supported), troubleshooting sections, case studies, quizzes, summaries, and exercises. Ensure cross-platform handling (Windows, Linux, macOS) for setups and installations. The textbook will map the provided course details into 6-8 chapters, each with at least 3 lessons, covering all weeks (1-13) and modules (1-4) in depth. Content must be dense to support future RAG integration, personalization (based on user background like Python knowledge, hardware access), and Urdu translation. Detailed Book Structure The textbook will be organized into 7 main chapters to balance brevity (readable in <45 minutes) with depth, while covering the entire course. Chapters will align with the quarter overview, modules, weekly breakdown, learning outcomes, assessments, hardware requirements, and capstone project. Each chapter includes: Introduction: Overview, relevance to Physical AI, and learning objectives tiered by audience level. Lessons: Minimum 3 per chapter, each with sub-sections for theory, hands-on practice, advanced topics, and research insights. Hands-On Sections: Code snippets (Python/ROS 2), simulation guides (Gazebo/Unity/Isaac), and exercises. Interactive Elements: Auto-generated summaries, quizzes (multiple-choice, short-answer), and learning boosters (tips, further reading). Cross-Platform Guides: Step-by-step setups for Windows, Linux, macOS, including edge cases (e.g., dual-boot, cloud alternatives). Personalization Hooks: Markers for adaptive content (e.g., [BEGINNER: Basic Python intro] vs. [EXPERT: Advanced optimization]). Translation Readiness: Content structured for easy translation (short paragraphs, no complex idioms). End-of-Chapter: Assessments, key takeaways, and links to capstone integration.
