command: /sp.constitution Constitution for Spec-Driven Development of the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" Textbook Vision The vision of this project is to create a comprehensive, interactive, and AI-native textbook titled "Teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course" that bridges the gap between digital AI and embodied intelligence in the physical world. This textbook will serve as a unified educational platform, empowering learners from beginners to experts and researchers to master the principles and practices of Physical AI and humanoid robotics. By leveraging Spec-Kit Plus, Claude Code, and Docusaurus, the textbook will be spec-driven, ensuring structured, high-quality content generation and deployment. The end product will be a fast, simple, beautiful, and intelligent resource that feels like a real AI-powered education platform, not just a static book. It will emphasize hands-on learning, personalization, and accessibility across devices and skill levels, ultimately democratizing access to cutting-edge robotics education and inspiring the next generation of innovators in embodied AI. Core Principles Hands-On Learning Focus: Every chapter and lesson must prioritize practical, actionable content with code examples, simulations, and exercises. Theoretical concepts should be immediately followed by hands-on implementations using tools like ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, and Unity. Encourage experimentation in simulated environments to build confidence before real-world applications. Multi-Level Accessibility: Content must cater to a broad target audience—beginners (new to AI/robotics), intermediate (familiar with basics), experts (advanced practitioners), and researchers (exploring cutting-edge topics). Each chapter should include tiered sections: foundational explanations for beginners, in-depth analyses for intermediates, advanced techniques for experts, and research insights/discussions for researchers. Use progressive disclosure (e.g., expandable sections) to avoid overwhelming users. Content Density and Richness: All content must be heavy and detailed, with each chapter containing at least 3 lessons. Cover all weeks from the course breakdown in rich detail, including code snippets, diagrams, troubleshooting tips, and real-world case studies. Ensure modules, chapters, lessons, and weeks are comprehensively fleshed out with subtopics, examples, and assessments to support RAG integration for personalized querying. Cross-Platform Compatibility: Handle installations, setups, and scenarios for major operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS) and critical edge cases (e.g., low-end hardware, cloud vs. on-premise). Provide step-by-step guides for each OS, including dependencies, potential pitfalls, and alternatives (e.g., using Docker for consistency). AI-Native and Interactive Design: Integrate reusable intelligence via Claude Code subagents and agent skills. The textbook should feel dynamic, with auto-generated summaries, quizzes, and learning boosters per chapter. Support personalization based on user background (e.g., Python proficiency, hardware access) and one-click Urdu translation, saved as user preferences after sign-in. Spec-Driven Development: Use Spec-Kit Plus to drive the project through a structured frontend workflow: constitution.md (this document), specify.md (detailed specs), plan.md (development plan), task.md (task breakdown), implement.md (implementation notes). All content generation must adhere to these specs for consistency and quality. Tech Stack Integrity: Build with Docusaurus for the frontend documentation site, Context7 MCP for accessing Docusaurus and integrating with OpenAI/ChatKit, GitHub MCP for deployment via deploy.yaml in .github/workflows. Use Claude (globally routed), Gemini, Qwen, and Spec-Kit Plus for content generation and humanoid book documentation. Ensure seamless integration for Phase 1 (textbook completion) and Phase 2 (RAG chatbot). Ethical and Inclusive Education: Promote safe, responsible AI practices in robotics, addressing biases in embodied systems, safety in human-robot interactions, and accessibility for diverse users. Encourage open-source contributions and community building. Success Criteria Content Completeness: All modules (1-4), weeks (1-13), chapters (6-8 total, mapping to course structure), and lessons (minimum 3 per chapter) are fully developed with heavy, rich, detailed content. This includes foundations, simulations, hardware setups, capstone projects, assessments, and learning outcomes. User Experience: Clean UI in Docusaurus—fast loading (<2 seconds per page), mobile-friendly, and readable in under 45 minutes total. Personalized content visibly adapts (e.g., skipping basics for experts), Urdu translations are high-quality and instant, and interactive elements (summaries, quizzes) enhance engagement. Hands-On Effectiveness: At least 70% of content involves practical exercises. Users can follow setups on Windows/Linux/macOS without friction, with success measured by deployable code examples and simulations. RAG Readiness: Content is structured for easy ingestion into Qdrant (e.g., markdown with headers, frontmatter metadata). Post-RAG, answers are accurate, cited, and grounded in book content. Deployment and Stability: Textbook deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub MCP. All features (personalization, translation) functional after sign-in using Better-Auth. Bonus points for implementing sign-up questions on user background (e.g., Python level, hardware like NVIDIA GPU) to personalize content. Quality Metrics: No overly long chapters (keep concise yet detailed), error-free code, and positive simulated user feedback (e.g., via quizzes passing rates). Achieve 50 extra bonus points by integrating Better-Auth for sign-up/sign-in with background questions. Constraints Budget and Resources: Rely on free tiers (Qdrant Cloud, Neon Serverless Postgres) and open-source tools. Avoid heavy dependencies; use minimal npm/Python libs. Support low-end devices (phones, non-RTX laptops) by offering cloud alternatives (AWS RoboMaker, Omniverse Cloud). Scope Limits: Phase 1 focuses solely on textbook completion—no RAG implementation yet (reserved for Phase 2). No complex robotics code; stick to educational content. Non-goals: extra animations, long chapters, or unrelated features. Time and Complexity: Complete in hackathon timeline. Keep frontend simple (Docusaurus defaults), backend modular (FastAPI for Phase 2). Mitigate risks like RAG accuracy with smart chunking in advance. Technical: Must work with installed tools (Claude as router, Gemini, Qwen, Spec-Kit Plus). Handle truncated files via tools if needed, but assume manual setups (deploy.yaml) are done. Content Boundaries: No promotion of disallowed activities; focus on ethical, educational robotics. Stakeholders Learners (Primary Users): Beginners to researchers seeking hands-on Physical AI education. Needs: Accessible, personalized, interactive content across devices. Educators/Instructors: Use the textbook for courses. Needs: Comprehensive modules, assessments, and capstone projects for teaching. Hackathon Organizers/Judges: Evaluate based on deliverables (Docusaurus book, RAG chatbot, personalization, translation). Bonus for Better-Auth integration. Developers (Us): Building with Spec-Kit Plus/Claude Code. Needs: Clear specs, reusable skills/agents for efficiency. Community/Researchers: Contribute to/open-source the project. Needs: Detailed, research-level insights and extensible architecture. Tech Providers: xAI/Grok (for assistance), OpenAI (agents/ChatKit), Cohere (embeddings), Qdrant/Neon (data), Better-Auth (auth). Brand Voice and Style Tone: Enthusiastic, empowering, and approachable—like a knowledgeable mentor guiding you through exciting discoveries. Use simple language for beginners, escalating to technical precision for advanced users. Style: Clear, concise, and visual. Use markdown effectively: headers for structure, code blocks for examples, tables for comparisons (e.g., hardware options), lists for steps. Interweave diagrams (via tools if needed) and encourage active voice. Inclusivity: Gender-neutral, culturally sensitive (e.g., Urdu support). Highlight real-world impact (e.g., "Why Physical AI Matters"). Consistency: Follow Docusaurus conventions. Brand as "Panaversity Physical AI Textbook" with modern, clean aesthetics (minimalist themes). Mission (Reiterated for Emphasis) Build a fully AI-native, interactive, intelligent textbook that teaches the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. The product must be fast, simple, beautiful, and feel like a REAL AI-powered education platform not just a book. Architecture Principles (Detailed for Implementation) Folder Structure: /website (Docusaurus frontend), /backend (FastAPI for Phase 2), /rag (indexing/retrieval), /agents (Claude subagents), /skills (reusable skills like RAG-Indexer). Content Generation: Use Spec-Kit Plus to generate all modules/chapters/lessons/weeks/levels with heavy details. Map course overview: Module 1 (ROS 2) → Chapters 1-2, etc. Personalization/Translation: After sign-in, buttons at chapter starts for personalization (based on sign-up questions: Python knowledge, hardware background) and Urdu translation (saved preference). Interactive Features: Auto-summaries, quizzes per chapter. RAG popup for selected text searches. Risks & Mitigation Content Overload: Mitigate by tiered levels and short chapters. Cross-OS Issues: Provide explicit guides and test scenarios. RAG Prep: Use semantic chunking (headers, 500 tokens max, 50 overlap) for markdown files. Deployment Failures: Use GitHub MCP and health checks. Definition of Done (Phase 1) All content generated: 6-8 chapters covering modules/weeks, with ≥3 lessons each, rich details for all levels. Docusaurus site deployed, with constitution.md etc. in docs. Ready for Phase 2: Structured markdown for RAG ingestion.

## Outcome

The project constitution located at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` has been significantly updated and expanded to reflect a comprehensive vision, core principles, success criteria, constraints, stakeholders, brand voice, mission, architecture principles, risks, and definition of done for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" Textbook project.

The constitution version has been set to `1.0.0` due to the introduction of a detailed, foundational document replacing a placeholder template. The `Last Amended` date has been updated to `2025-12-10`. The `Ratified` date has been marked as a `TODO` for future determination.

## Actions Taken

1.  **Updated Constitution File**: The content of `.specify/memory/constitution.md` was overwritten with the detailed constitution provided by the user.
2.  **Updated `plan-template.md`**: The `Constitution Check` section in `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` was updated to include a checklist of the new core principles.
3.  **Updated `spec-template.md`**: Guiding comments were added to the `Requirements` and `Success Criteria` sections of `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to ensure alignment with the constitutional principles and success criteria.
4.  **Updated `tasks-template.md`**: A guiding note was added to the `Notes` section of `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` to emphasize adherence to constitutional principles during task execution.
5.  **Updated `.claude/commands/*.md` files**:
    *   `.claude/commands/sp.adr.md`: Reviewed and deemed acceptable as agent-specific references were in context.
    *   `.claude/commands/sp.plan.md`: Reviewed and deemed acceptable as agent-specific references were in context.
    *   `.claude/commands/sp.specify.md`: A note was added to the `For AI Generation` section to link spec generation to `Spec-Driven Development` and constitutional `Success Criteria`.
    *   `.claude/commands/sp.tasks.md`: A note was added to the `Outline` section to emphasize task generation with constitutional principles in mind.

## Next Steps / Manual Follow-up

*   **`README.md`**: The root `README.md` file was empty and needs to be populated with a project overview that aligns with the newly defined constitution.
*   **Agent Command Files**: While updates were made or deemed acceptable based on current understanding, a manual review of all agent-specific command files (`.claude/commands/`, `.gemini/commands/`, `.qwen/commands/`) is recommended to ensure complete alignment and consistency with the multi-agent strategy outlined in the constitution, especially regarding generic guidance versus agent-specific functionalities.
