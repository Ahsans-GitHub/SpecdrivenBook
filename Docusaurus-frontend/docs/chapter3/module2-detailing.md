# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Focus: Physics Simulation and Environment Building

Welcome to Module 2 of Chapter 3, where we immerse ourselves in the practical aspects of creating and manipulating digital twins using industry-standard simulation platforms: Gazebo and Unity. This module is dedicated to equipping you with the skills to build realistic virtual environments and simulate the complex physics that govern humanoid robot interaction with the physical world.

The ability to accurately simulate physics – including gravity, collisions, and various material properties – is paramount for effective robotics development. It allows for rigorous testing of control algorithms, generation of diverse training data for machine learning, and safe exploration of behaviors before deployment on expensive and delicate physical hardware. We will cover how to define robot kinematics and dynamics, integrate sophisticated sensor models, and render visually compelling virtual worlds that enhance both development and human-robot interaction.
